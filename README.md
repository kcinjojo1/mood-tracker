# Mood Tracker

A simple mood tracking web app built with **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
Users can record daily actions (yes/no via green/red buttons), track progress over time, and view charts of their habits.  
All data is stored locally on the device in `localStorage`, with options to **export** and **import** as JSON for backup.
